If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, their audio aura could be characterized by analyzing the mood, energy, genre, and tempo of those songs.
For instance, if most of the tracks are upbeat and energetic, the aura might be vibrant and extroverted. If the songs are slower and more introspective, the aura might be calmer and more reflective.

However, this method might not fully represent the listener's overall preferences.
The analysis only reflects their music tastes during 2018, which could have been influenced by specific life events, trends, or even just a temporary phase.
Additionally, focusing solely on the top 100 songs may overlook other music that the listener enjoys but didn’t play as frequently that year.

To better calculate the listener’s audio aura, it would be beneficial to look at their top songs over multiple years, incorporate data from other music platforms or sources, and even consider their emotional or contextual reasons for listening to certain songs.
This broader approach would provide a more accurate and holistic view of their musical identity.
